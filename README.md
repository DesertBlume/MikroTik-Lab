# MikroTik-Lab

A hands-on lab for exploring cloud routing and cross-platform router configuration using MikroTik CHR and Cisco IOS.

## Purpose

Most students in networking programs only get exposure to Cisco devices. While that builds foundational skills, it can lead to a narrow understanding of routing concepts.

This lab is designed to broaden your perspective.

By working with both **Cisco IOS** and **MikroTik RouterOS**, you'll gain:

- A deeper understanding of how routing protocols like **OSPF** behave across platforms
- Practical experience with **virtualized routers** (CHR on VMware)
- Confidence in interpreting and adapting to different CLI syntaxes
- A better appreciation for **vendor-neutral networking skills**

## What You'll Do

- Configure a Cisco router as your core (R1)
- Deploy and configure two MikroTik CHR routers (T1 and T2)
- Set up IP addressing, loopbacks, and interface roles
- Establish OSPF adjacencies between Cisco and MikroTik routers
- Verify neighbor relationships and routing table propagation

## Who This Is For

This lab is for **networking students, instructors, lab assistants, and curious professionals** who want to:

- Break out of the Cisco-only mindset
- Learn how to apply core routing knowledge across platforms
- Prepare for real-world environments that mix vendor equipment

## Requirements

- VMware Workstation
- MikroTik CHR image (available free from [mikrotik.com/download](https://mikrotik.com/download))
- Cisco IOS (on GNS3, EVE-NG, or physical gear)
- Basic understanding of IP addressing and routing protocols

## What's Included

- A full lab guide (`Mikrotik Lab Setup`)
- MikroTik `.vmx` config for quick setup
- Clean CLI commands with annotations
- OSPF configuration steps for both Cisco and MikroTik

## Contribute

Suggestions, corrections, and pull requests are welcome! This lab is a living resource aimed at helping students and self-learners level up.
