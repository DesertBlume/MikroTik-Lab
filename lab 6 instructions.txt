!!!! MIKROTIK - cloning 
!!! GO INTO EDIT >> VIRTUAL NETWORK ADAPTER >> BOTTON CLICK ON CHANGE SETTINGS >>
!! CHECK THAT VMNET0 IS BRIDGED TO REALTEK (BLACK PORT)
!! your bridged adapter will be the one physically connected to your router through
!! the black port we usually use for vms on the patch panel on your pod
!! CLICK ADD NETWORK SELECT VMNET 1 make sure its host only 
!! UNCHECK USE LOCAL DHCP SERVICE TO DISTRIBUTE IP ADDRESS TO VMS 
!! this will be your virtual link to your virtual router T2.
!! copy the vmx file provided and replace the existing vmx file located in 
!! C:\Users\Student\Documents\Virtual Machines\chr-7.19.1.vmdk
!! its called MikroTIK7.19.1 and under type it will be VMware virtual machine configuration (might have to expand type)
!! once you pasted the vmx config provided in the lab onto the vmx config in the directions
!! start up the machine to make sure it runs 
!! LOGIN NAME IS : admin
!! PASSWORD IS : admin
!! YOU ARE NOW IN THE CONFIGURATION PLACE congradulations!

!!CLONE THE MikroTik CHR router 
!! MAKE SURE ITS NOT A LINKED CLONE! 
!! NAME THE CLONE T1
!!CLONE THE MikroTik CHR router AGAIN!!!
!! MAKE SURE ITS NOT A LINKED CLONE! 
!! NAME THE CLONE T2

!! ON T1 add two adapters 
!! custom both. first vmnet0 your bridged adapter 
!! second vmnet1 your host only adapter
!! TYPE interface print. that'll list all the your adapter's interfaces. 
!! you should see three. one for vmnet0, vmnet1 and a loopback one.
!! the first two should be named ether#
!! figure out which one is your vmnet0 and which is vmnet 1
!! rename the interfaces to match the topology 
!! interface set [the original interface name] name=[name on topology]
!! set ip addresses 
!! ip address add address=x.x.x.x/24 interface=[name of the interface] 
!! if you make a mistake and would like to remove an ip add
!! first type interface print 
[admin@MikroTik] > interface/print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, TYPE, ACTUAL-MTU, L2MTU, MAC-ADDRESS
#   NAME  TYPE      ACTUAL-MTU  L2MTU  MAC-ADDRESS

2 R loop  bridge          1500  65535  DE:88:56:E9:1C:FF
!! see the '#' thats the number of the interface keep that in mind 
to remove an ip address use 
ip address remove numbers=[put the value under # of the ip address you want to remove]


on T2 
add only ONE ADAPTER MAKE SURE ITS VMNET1 THE HOST ONLY NETWORK!
follow the steps for T1 but with T2's addressing 
to make a loopback interface
interface bridge add name=[name of your loopback]
ip address add address=10.U.22.2/24 interface=[the name of the one you just created]

type / and click enter
try to ping from T1 to T2 if you figured out with interface on T1 was host only and which was bridged 
and applied the correct ip addresses you should be able to ping through 
if that succeeds 
on T1 ping the RA on the directly connected link
if that works! bravo you are solid 

if that does not work 
DO NO PROCEED UNTIL IT DOES PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT DO FURTHER i love you 

to enable ospf 
on T1
type / and then click enter 
routing ospf instance add name=ospf1 (this is the same as a process number in cisco) router-id=U.0.0.1
routing ospf area add name=backbone (an easy way to refer to the area) area=0.0.0.0 (this is area 0 i know different from cisco) instance=(can you guess what you will be putting here?)ospf1

routing ospf interface-template add interface=[choose the name of the interface you want ospf enabled] 
networks=[the network id of that interface 10.U.10.0/24] area=[name of the area backbone] 

you'll have to do the interface-template command again but for the other interface and it's network 
routing ospf interface-template add interface=[choose the name of the interface you want ospf enabled] 
networks=[the network id of that interface 10.U.12.0/24] area=[name of the area backbone] 
thats the only command you have to do per interface per network 

assuming you have already configured ospf on your cisco router
and you were able to ping 
and you didn't use matching router-ids 
an ospf neigh relationship should form and you should be able to view it with 
sh ip ospf neigh on cisco and 
[admin@MikroTik] > routing ospf neigh prin

DO NOT PROCEED IF THIS HAS NOT FORMED!
now use that to do the same for T2
